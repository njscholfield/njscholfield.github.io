        <h2>Eagle Scout Project</h2>
          <p>For my Eagle Scout project I created a virtual tour of a cemetery with graves dating back to the 1700s. I, with the help of some volunteers, took pictures of all of 600+ tombstones and uploaded them along with a typed version of the inscription that was on the stone. Many of the stones were so old that it was difficult or impossible to read the inscription and I had to rely on a book of the inscriptions and a map to try to match them up. I think that this project will help perserve the history that the cemetery contains and maybe allow people to see the graves of family members.</p>
